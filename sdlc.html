                                            <p class="mb-30">There are six basic methods to a system development life cycle (SDLC). These are agile, lean, waterfall, iterative, spiral, and DevOps. However, the two that I most familiar with are the waterfall approach and
                                                the agile approach
                                            </p>


                                            <p class="mb-30"></p>


                                            <p class="mb-30"> A waterfall method is a structed traditional methodology. When this method is utilized by system analysist and designers, there are seven steps they must follow in iteration starting back from the Planning or
                                                sometimes the requirements stage of the software development life cycle. The seven steps are Planning, Requirements (anaylsis), Design and Prototyping, Software Development, Testing, Deployment, Operations
                                                and Maintenance. In the planning stage, where the project management experts operate at, there is a huge focus on the scope of the project. Let us say that you (the stakeholder) want to build a party application
                                                where users can find places they can physically attend and have a good time (a real-life example of this application will be Eventbrite). However, due to Covid-19, all locations are closed, and your business
                                                is losing revenue. To hold a stable financial point, you decide to integrate a video call party feature into the system. This feature will allow multiple people who have the same interest in a topic to meet
                                                up to enter a Group FaceTime call. To get this done you meet a system analyst and plan out what how long the integration will take and how much things will cost. Once that is done the requirement stage is
                                                the next step, In the requirement step the system anaylsist team will extract what they need to do, in other words what problem they need to solve. The third level is the design and prototype stage, in this
                                                stage one or many prototypes are built and presented to stakeholders. The prototype will be heavily analyzed for improvements. When the prototype has been designed to its most perfect design, the actual
                                                development of the application will begin. The final product of the code will then be moved to a testing environment. Back to the party app example, in this stage the front-end code and the database of the
                                                software will be thrown onto a Platform as a Service(PaaS) such as Elastic Beanstalk in AWS. once the stakeholders are satisfied with the application, the software will be pushed to a deployment stage. Even
                                                though the development of a software does not have an ending phase, operation and maintenance is the last phase in the waterfall methodology, in this phase the software will monitored for an deficiencies.
                                                Every time there is a change either in the software from the development team or the stakeholders, the software development will start from the first phase, planning or sometimes the second stage, requirements.
                                                Due to this illation, system anaylsist will take a longer time deploying updated versions of the software.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="mb-30">
                                                The agile approach was developed to solve the waterfall “time management” problem. The agile method is the process of rapidly deploying well-organized application(s), which adheres to changes made from the developers, stakeholders, requirements, or technologies.
                                                There are multiple frameworks under the agile method; one well-known framework is the Scrum framework.
